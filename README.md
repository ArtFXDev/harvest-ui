  Statistics dashboard for Pixar's Tractor render farm<br>

## Introduction

Harvest is a realtime front-end application to display useful statistics for the Tractor render farm.

It connects to [`harvest-api`](https://github.com/ArtFXDev/harvest-api) which is the backend API.

It's built on the great [Recharts](https://recharts.org) library for graphics, uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for the styling and powerful type system with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org/) and [React](reactjs.org/).

## Installation

The package manager used is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ArtFXDev/harvest-ui
$ cd harvest-ui
$ yarn install # Install the dependencies
```

## Usage

### Environment variables

Before starting the UI, make sure the variables defined in the [`.env`](.env) file are correct.

They are:

- `REACT_APP_HARVEST_API_URL` - the url of the Harvest backend API.

### Available scripts

- üöÄ `yarn start` -> runs the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) development server with HMR (hot module replacement).

  You can then access the app on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

- üë∑ `yarn build` -> builds and bundle the whole app in a `build` folder. It is used to host the static files on a web server like Nginx or Apache.

- üî® `yarn tsc` -> runs the TypeScript compiler and report errors. Add `:watch` to run an interactive process that watches file changes.

- üíÖ `yarn prettify` -> prettify the code with Prettier. Add `:write` to write the modifications.

- üö® `yarn lint` -> shows ESLint warnings and errors. Add `:fix` to apply auto fixes.
